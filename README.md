What I'm currently focusing on:

💻 Building modern, user-friendly interfaces with a focus on clean code.

☁️ Learning how to develop and manage App Services to bring applications to the cloud.

🎓 Gaining deep insights into the full software development lifecycle during my apprenticeship.

I love exploring how frontend and Backend logic interacts with cloud environments and I'm always looking for ways to optimize my deployment workflows
